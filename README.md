Training Data Poisoning 
Introduction
Training data poisoning is a serious security threat to AI/LLM applications. It involves the malicious modification of training data to manipulate the model's behavior, leading to biased outputs, incorrect predictions, or even backdoors for malicious code execution. This handout provides resources and guidance on testing for training data poisoning vulnerabilities.

Understanding Training Data Poisoning
Training data poisoning attacks exploit the AI/LLM model's reliance on large datasets for learning. By injecting malicious or misleading data into the training set, attackers can influence the model's output or behavior. 

Types of Training Data Poisoning Attacks
Data Injection: Inserting incorrect or misleading data points into the training set
Data Modification: Altering existing data points to introduce bias or errors
Logic Corruption: Injecting data that forces the model to learn incorrect relationships or correlations
Testing for Training Data Poisoning Vulnerabilities
Testing for training data poisoning requires a multi-faceted approach, combining various techniques and tools.

Data Sanitization and Validation:

Data Source Verification: Verify the integrity and authenticity of training data sources
Data Cleaning: Implement rigorous data cleaning processes to identify and remove potentially malicious or biased data
Statistical Analysis: Use statistical methods to detect anomalies or outliers in the training data
Model Training and Evaluation:

Cross-Validation: Divide the training data into multiple subsets and train the model on different combinations to assess its robustness to poisoned data
Adversarial Training: Introduce adversarial examples (slightly modified inputs designed to fool the model) during training to improve its resilience
Model Explainability: Utilize techniques to understand the model's decision-making process and identify potential biases or vulnerabilities
Monitoring and Auditing:

Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance for unexpected changes or degradation
Data Provenance Tracking: Track the origin and modifications of training data to identify potential sources of poisoning
Regular Audits: Conduct periodic audits of the training data and model to detect any signs of compromise
